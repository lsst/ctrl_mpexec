Add options to speed up `pipetask report`, with some enabled by defualt.

By default, `pipetask report --force-v2` now uses quantum-backed butler and only reads metadata for quanta for which at least one predicted output was not produced (`--read-caveats=lazy`).
It can also parallelize metadata reads via the `-j` option.
