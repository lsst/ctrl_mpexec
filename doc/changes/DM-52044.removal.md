Removes multiple `pipetask` options:

- `--save-execution-butler`, `--clobber-execution-butler`, `--target-datastore-root`, `--transfer`: execution butler has been fully superseded by quantum-backed butler.
- `--order-pipeline`: already does nothing.
- `--save-single-quanta`: superseded by support for single-quantum reads from larger quantum graph files.
