    """Implementation of QuantumGraphExecutor using same-host multiprocess
    execution of Quanta.

    This is a deprecated backwards-compatibility shim for
    `lsst.pipe.base.mp_graph_executor.MPGraphExecutor`, which has
    the same functionality with very minor interface changes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    numProc : `int`
        Number of processes to use for executing tasks.
    timeout : `float`
        Time in seconds to wait for tasks to finish.
    quantumExecutor : `lsst.pipe.base.quantum_graph_executor.QuantumExecutor`
        Executor for single quantum. For multiprocess-style execution when
        ``num_proc`` is greater than one this instance must support pickle.
    startMethod : `str`, optional
        Start method from `multiprocessing` module, `None` selects the best
        one for current platform.
    failFast : `bool`, optional
        If set to ``True`` then stop processing on first error from any task.
    pdb : `str`, optional
        Debugger to import and use (via the ``post_mortem`` function) in the
        event of an exception.
    executionGraphFixup : \
            `lsst.pipe.base.execution_graph_fixup.ExecutionGraphFixup`, \
            optional
        Instance used for modification of execution graph.
