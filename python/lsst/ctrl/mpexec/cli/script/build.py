    """Implements the command line interface `pipetask build` subcommand,
    should only be called by command line tools and unit test code that tests
    this function.

    Build and optionally save pipeline definition.

    Returns the pipeline instance that was built, for testing and for using
    this function with other script functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    order_pipeline : `bool`
        If true, order tasks in pipeline based on their data dependencies,
        ordering is performed as last step before saving or executing pipeline.
    pipeline_actions : `list` [`PipelineAction`]] or `PipelineAction`
        A list of pipeline actions in the order they should be executed.
    pipeline_dot : `str`
        Path location for storing GraphViz DOT representation of a pipeline.
    pipeline : `str`
        Path location of a pipeline definition file in YAML format.
    save_pipeline : `str`
        Path location for storing resulting pipeline definition in YAML format.
    expand_pipeline : `str`
        Directory path location for storing the expanded pipeline definition,
        with all references to other files resolved and written to config files
        in the directory.
    show : `list` [`str`]
        Descriptions of what to dump to stdout.
    kwargs : `dict` [`str`, `str`]
        Ignored; click commands may accept options for more than one script
        function and pass all the option kwargs to each of the script functions
        which ingore these unused kwargs.

    Returns
    -------
    pipeline : `lsst.pipe.base.Pipeline`
        The pipeline instance that was built.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        Raised if there is a failure building the pipeline.
