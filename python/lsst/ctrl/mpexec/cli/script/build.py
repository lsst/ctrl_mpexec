    """Implement the command line interface `pipetask build` subcommand.

    Should only be called by command line tools and unit test code that tests
    this function.

    Build and optionally save pipeline definition.

    Returns the pipeline instance that was built, for testing and for using
    this function with other script functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    order_pipeline : `bool`
        If true, order tasks in pipeline based on their data dependencies,
        ordering is performed as last step before saving or executing pipeline.
    pipeline : `str`
        Path location of a pipeline definition file in YAML format.
    pipeline_actions : `list` [`PipelineAction`]] or `PipelineAction`
        A list of pipeline actions in the order they should be executed.
    pipeline_dot : `str`
        Path location for storing GraphViz DOT representation of a pipeline.
    pipeline_mermaid : `str`
        Path location for storing Mermaid representation of a pipeline.
    save_pipeline : `str`
        Path location for storing resulting pipeline definition in YAML format.
    show : `lsst.ctrl.mpexec.showInfo.ShowInfo`
        Descriptions of what to dump to stdout.
    butler_config : `str`, `dict`, or `lsst.daf.butler.Config`, optional
        If `str`, `butler_config` is the path location of the gen3
        butler/registry config file. If `dict`, `butler_config` is key value
        pairs used to init or update the `lsst.daf.butler.Config` instance. If
        `Config`, it is the object used to configure a Butler.
        Only used to resolve pipeline graphs for --show pipeline-graph and
        --show task-graph.
    **kwargs
        Ignored; click commands may accept options for more than one script
        function and pass all the option kwargs to each of the script functions
        which ingore these unused kwargs.

    Returns
    -------
    pipeline : `lsst.pipe.base.Pipeline`
        The pipeline instance that was built.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        Raised if there is a failure building the pipeline.
