    """Implement the command line interface `pipetask run` subcommand.

    Should only be called by command line tools and unit test code that test
    this function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pdb : `bool`
        Drop into pdb on exception or not.
    graph_fixup : `str`
        The name of the class or factory method which makes an instance used
        for execution graph fixup.
    init_only : `bool`
        If true, do not actually run; just register dataset types and/or save
        init outputs.
    no_versions : `bool`
        If true, do not save or check package versions.
    processes : `int`
        The number of processes to use.
    start_method : `str` or `None`
        Start method from `multiprocessing` module, `None` selects the best
        one for current platform.
    profile : `str`
        File name to dump cProfile information to.
    qgraphObj : `lsst.pipe.base.QuantumGraph`
        A QuantumGraph generated by a previous subcommand.
    register_dataset_types : `bool`
        If true, register DatasetTypes that do not already exist in the
        Registry.
    skip_init_writes : `bool`
        If true, do not write collection-wide 'init output' datasets (e.g.
        schemas).
    timeout : `int`
        Timeout for multiprocessing; maximum wall time (sec).
    butler_config : `str`, `dict`, or `lsst.daf.butler.Config`
        If `str`, `butler_config` is the path location of the gen3
        butler/registry config file. If `dict`, `butler_config` is key value
        pairs used to init or update the `lsst.daf.butler.Config` instance. If
        `Config`, it is the object used to configure a Butler.
    input : `list` [ `str` ]
        List of names of the input collection(s).
    output : `str`
        Name of the output CHAINED collection. This may either be an existing
        CHAINED collection to use as both input and output (if `input` is
        `None`), or a new CHAINED collection created to include all inputs
        (if `input` is not `None`). In both cases, the collection's children
        will start with an output RUN collection that directly holds all new
        datasets (see `output_run`).
    output_run : `str`
        Name of the new output RUN collection. If not provided then `output`
        must be provided and a new RUN collection will be created by appending
        a timestamp to the value passed with `output`. If this collection
        already exists then `extend_run` must be passed.
    extend_run : `bool`
        Instead of creating a new RUN collection, insert datasets into either
        the one given by `output_run` (if provided) or the first child
        collection of `output` (which must be of type RUN).
    replace_run : `bool`
        Before creating a new RUN collection in an existing CHAINED collection,
        remove the first child collection (which must be of type RUN). This can
        be used to repeatedly write to the same (parent) collection during
        development, but it does not delete the datasets associated with the
        replaced run unless `prune-replaced` is also True. Requires `output`,
        and `extend_run` must be `None`.
    prune_replaced : "unstore", "purge", or `None`
        If not `None`, delete the datasets in the collection replaced by
        `replace_run`, either just from the datastore ("unstore") or by
        removing them and the RUN completely ("purge"). Requires `replace_run`.
    data_query : `str`
        User query selection expression.
    skip_existing_in : `list` [ `str` ]
        Accepts list of collections, if all Quantum outputs already exist in
        the specified list of collections then that Quantum will be excluded
        from the QuantumGraph.
    skip_existing : `bool`
        Appends output RUN collection to the ``skip_existing_in`` list.
    debug : `bool`
        If true, enable debugging output using lsstDebug facility (imports
        debug.py).
    fail_fast : `bool`
        If true then stop processing at first error, otherwise process as many
        tasks as possible.
    clobber_outputs : `bool`
        Remove outputs from previous execution of the same quantum before new
        execution.  Only applies to failed quanta if skip_existing is also
        given.
    summary : `str`
        File path to store job report in JSON format.
    mock : `bool`, optional
        If `True` then run mock pipeline instead of real one.  Ignored if an
        existing QuantumGraph is provided.
    unmocked_dataset_types : `collections.abc.Sequence` [ `str` ]
        List of overall-input dataset types that should not be mocked.
        Ignored if an existing QuantumGraph is provided.
    mock_failure : `~collections.abc.Sequence`, optional
        List of quanta that should raise exceptions.
    enable_implicit_threading : `bool`, optional
        If `True`, do not disable implicit threading by third-party libraries.
        Implicit threading is always disabled during actual quantum execution
        if ``processes > 1``.
    cores_per_quantum : `int`
        Number of cores that can be used by each quantum.
    memory_per_quantum : `str`
        Amount of memory that each quantum can be allowed to use. Empty string
        implies no limit. The string can be either a single integer (implying
        units of MB) or a combination of number and unit.
    rebase : `bool`
        If `True` then reset output collection chain if it is inconsistent with
        the ``inputs``.
    raise_on_partial_outputs : `bool`
        Consider partial outputs an error instead of a success.
    **kwargs : `dict` [`str`, `str`]
        Ignored; click commands may accept options for more than one script
        function and pass all the option kwargs to each of the script functions
        which ignore these unused kwargs.
