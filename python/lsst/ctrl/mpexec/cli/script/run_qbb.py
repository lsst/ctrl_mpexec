    Parameters
    ----------
    butler_config : `str`
        The path location of the gen3 butler/registry config file.
    qgraph : `str`
        URI location for a serialized quantum graph definition.
    config_search_path : `list` [`str`]
        Additional search paths for butler configuration.
    qgraph_id : `str` or `None`
        Quantum graph identifier, if specified must match the identifier of the
        graph loaded from a file. Ignored if graph is not loaded from a file.
    qgraph_node_id : `iterable` of `int`, or `None`
        Only load a specified set of nodes if graph is loaded from a file,
        nodes are identified by integer IDs.
    processes : `int`
        The number of processes to use.
    pdb : `str` or `None`
        Debugger to launch for exceptions.
    profile : `str`
        File name to dump cProfile information to.
    debug : `bool`
        If true, enable debugging output using lsstDebug facility (imports
        debug.py).
    coverage : `bool`
        If true, run coverage.
    start_method : `str` or `None`
        Start method from `multiprocessing` module, `None` selects the best
        one for current platform.
    timeout : `int`
        Timeout for multiprocessing; maximum wall time (sec).
    fail_fast : `bool`
        If true then stop processing at first error, otherwise process as many
        tasks as possible.
    summary : `str` or `None`
        File path to store job report in JSON format.
    enable_implicit_threading : `bool`
        If `True`, do not disable implicit threading by third-party libraries.
        Implicit threading is always disabled during actual quantum execution
        if ``processes > 1``.
